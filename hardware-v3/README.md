# Hardware v3.0

This directory holds the hardware design assets for the SmartRV Water Tank Module v3.0.

- `pcb/`: EDA source files (EasyEDA Pro preferred; export KiCad variants if available).
- `manufacturing/`: Gerbers, drill, pick-and-place, and BOM for fabrication/assembly houses (e.g., JLCPCB).
- `3d/`: Enclosure and mechanical models.

Populate these folders with the latest design files as they are released. The v2.x hardware has been archived in [`../hardware-v2-legacy`](../hardware-v2-legacy/).
