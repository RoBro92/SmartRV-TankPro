# Hardware

This folder holds the SmartRV TankPro hardware design files. Unless noted otherwise in `legacy/`, the hardware is licensed under CERN OHL-W v2 (see `LICENSE-HARDWARE` at the repo root).

- `design/`: Placeholder for editable schematic/PCB sources. If none are present yet, the full EasyEDA/KiCad design files will be published here in a future OSHW release.
- `fabrication/`: Generated outputs (Gerbers, drill, pick-and-place, BOM, assembly drawings) suitable for board houses.
- `mechanical/`: Enclosure and mechanical CAD (STEP/DXF/STL) for panels and models.
- `legacy/`: Archived v1/v2 hardware retained for reference and kept under their original licences noted within.

Editable design source files will be added to `hardware/design/` once the OSHW release is published.
