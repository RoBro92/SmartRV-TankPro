# SmartRV TankPro – Legacy (v1.x/v2.x)

This directory archives the previous hardware generations of SmartRV TankPro (formerly the SmartRV Water Tank Module). These designs are **not recommended for new builds**. For the latest hardware and documentation, use [`../../hardware`](../../hardware/) and the root [`README`](../../README.md).

## Contents
- `V1 THT/`: Through-hole friendly v1.x design.
- `V2 SMD/`: Surface-mount v2.x design.
- [`README-legacy.md`](README-legacy.md): Archived copy of the original project README for reference.

## Notes
- Files are provided as-is for historical reference, validation, or comparison with v3.0.
- Manufacturing data may be outdated; check component availability and safety requirements before use.
- New contributors should focus on v3.0 unless specifically working on regression fixes for legacy hardware.
- Licensing: v1/v2 content in this folder remains under GNU GPLv3; see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for details. Current hardware in `../../hardware/` is released under CERN OHL-W v2 and firmware under the MIT License; see `LICENSE-HARDWARE` and `LICENSE-SOFTWARE` at the repo root.
