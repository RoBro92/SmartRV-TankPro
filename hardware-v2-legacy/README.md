This directory archives the previous hardware generations of the SmartRV Water Tank Module. These designs are **not recommended for new builds**. For the latest hardware and documentation, use [`../hardware-v3`](../hardware-v3/) and the root [`README`](../README.md).

## Contents
- `V1 THT/`: Through-hole friendly v1.x design.
- `V2 SMD/`: Surface-mount v2.x design.
- [`README-legacy.md`](README-legacy.md): Archived copy of the original project README for reference.

## Notes
- Files are provided as-is for historical reference, validation, or comparison with v3.0.
- Manufacturing data may be outdated; check component availability and safety requirements before use.
- New contributors should focus on v3.0 unless specifically working on regression fixes for legacy hardware.
