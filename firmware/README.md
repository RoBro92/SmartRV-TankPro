# Firmware

SmartRV TankPro firmware and configuration live here. All firmware/software content in this repository is released under the MIT License; see `LICENSE-SOFTWARE` in the repo root.

- `src/controller/`: ESPHome-based firmware for the controller (ESP32-C3) board.
- `src/display/`: Placeholder for a future external display client.

Example or environment-specific configuration files should live alongside the relevant sources (e.g., additional ESPHome YAMLs) or under a future `config/` folder if needed.
